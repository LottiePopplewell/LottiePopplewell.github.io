    <strong>Unique Behavior:</strong><br>
    Sunflowers, renowned for their large blooms, derive their name from their unique behavior of orienting their flowers from east to west to track the movement of the sun. Initially cultivated in North and South America, they have now spread to other continents such as Europe and Asia.<br><br>

    <strong>Towering Plants:</strong><br>
    These towering plants, reaching heights of 3 to 15 feet (1 to 4.5 meters), boast rough, hairy stems and wide, coarse leaves spanning 3 to 12 inches (8 to 30 centimeters) in length.<br><br>

    <strong>Main Sections of Bloom:</strong><br>
    A sunflower's bloom comprises two main sections: a central disk densely packed with small flowers in brown, yellow, or purple hues, and outer ray flowers sporting a radiant golden yellow hue. Some varieties showcase disk flowers expanding up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) in diameter.<br><br>

    <strong>Practical Applications:</strong><br>
    Sunflowers offer a multitude of practical applications. Their flowers yield a vibrant yellow dye, while their leaves serve as fodder for animals. The seeds, nestled within the disk flowers, yield a sweet, yellow oil extensively used in culinary endeavors, soap production, and paint manufacturing. Dried or roasted sunflower seeds are a popular snack enjoyed by many.
