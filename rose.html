  <p style="font-family:verdana;color:olivedrab;text-align: left;margin: 0 auto;max-width: 800px;">
    <strong>Ancient Roots:</strong><br>
    Roses have been around for over 35 million years, making them one of the oldest flowering plants. They were prized by ancient civilizations like the Greeks and Romans for their medicinal properties and decorative uses.<br><br>

    <strong>Ageless Beauties:</strong><br>
    The oldest living rose, dating back to A.D. 815, thrives on the walls of the Cathedral of Hildesheim in Germany. Despite wartime destruction, it continues to flourish, symbolizing the prosperity of the city.<br><br>

    <strong>Edible Elegance:</strong><br>
    Roses aren't just for show; their petals are edible and have been used for centuries in culinary and medicinal preparations. Just be sure to use chemical-free roses for consumption.<br><br>

    <strong>Vitamin-Packed Berries:</strong><br>
    Some rose species produce fruit called rose hips, rich in vitamin C. Dried rose hips are commonly used to make tea, jams, and syrups.<br><br>

    <strong>Perfume Power:</strong><br>
    Rose oil, extracted from the petals, is a prized ingredient in perfumes. It takes thousands of roses to produce just one gram of oil, making rose-scented perfumes a luxury.<br><br>

    <strong>Colourful Meanings:</strong><br>
    Each rose colour conveys a different message. From red symbolizing love to white representing purity, the colour choice adds depth to the sentiment behind the gift.<br><br>

    <strong>Myth of the Black Rose:</strong><br>
    While often romanticized, true black roses don't exist naturally. Varieties marketed as black are actually deep red, and blue roses are a result of genetic modification.<br><br>

    <strong>National Emblem:</strong><br>
    In 1986, President Ronald Reagan declared the rose as the national flower emblem of the United States, a symbol of beauty and resilience.<br><br>

    <strong>Presidential Roses:</strong><br>
    Presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln shared a love for roses. Washington was the first rose breeder in the U.S., while Lincoln has roses named in his honour.<br><br>

    <strong>Pricey Petals:</strong><br>
    The most expensive rose, Juliet, was developed by rose breeder David Austin over 15 years, costing $5 million to create. It sold for a staggering $15.8 million in 2006.
